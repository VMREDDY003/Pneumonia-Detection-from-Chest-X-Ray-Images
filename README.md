## 🌟 Project Overview

Early and accurate detection of **pneumonia** is critical in saving lives. This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** leveraging the power of **MobileNetV2** to classify chest X-ray images into **pneumonia** or **normal** categories.

This automated approach aims to assist radiologists and healthcare providers by reducing diagnosis time and improving accuracy.
